1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git file is created. You need to initialize a repository before you can start making commits and tracking file changes

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A. The staging area is where you park files before you make a commit. You can't do any work or make file changes while they are in the 
staging area. It adds a value by gathering multiple files to make a commit instead of doing a commit of multiple files
